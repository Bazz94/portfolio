# Portfolio
My software developer portfolio. It consists of a 3d background made with three.js and the foreground of sliding text made with HTML and CSS.
The background is a simulation of a solar system. All planetary bodies affect each other with their own gravity. The users can interact with
the solar system by spawning a planet with velocity or a gravity well that pulls other planets. The website is also reactive and runs well on 
mobile devices although the actions will be disabled. Performance mode stops the animation loop.
